This example demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: violating subtype constraints.  The `Positive` subtype is defined with a range of 1 to `Integer'Last`, but an attempt is made to assign 0, which is outside this range. This results in a compilation error.  The solution shows how to avoid this error by performing input validation before assigning values to the subtype or using a different subtype that allows 0.
